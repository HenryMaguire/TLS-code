This directory will be for dealing with a TLS strongly coupled to vibrations.
There is:
- a central reaction coordinate Liouvillian builder called UD_liouv.py.
- a module which deals with all of the different types of incoherent driving called driving_liov.py
- a plotting module which takes in the other two and plots beautiful graphs. This could be extended into an ipython notebook as well.
